LaRPG: Sunny Bluebird Happy Pill Adventures

  LaRPG is an action RPG where the player controls a schizophrenic whose
activities are split between mundane day-to-day tasks (such as food shopping),
and wild role-playing forays fueled by a flagrant disregard for medicinal
containment.

  The core mechanic involves adventuring in a fantasy realm, gaining experience
and equipment in a quest to become more powerful and one day lay siege to the
stronghold of power that keeps you subjugated.

  However, in order to keep your own mind sorted out, you're going to need some
help. Your court-appointed psychiatrist is there for you, along with the Sunny
Bluebird Happy Pill company.

  When your day's journey as a great wizard or warrior leaves you satisfied,
simply take your medicine. In order to keep the memory of what you did
(experience gained) and what you found (equipment looted) fresh in your mixed-up
mind, you'll want to see the shrink and, when necessary, make sure that you have
a healthy supply of Sunny Bluebird Happy Pills or you may never make it back
next time...

  If your battles don't go the way you hoped, you'll wake up with no memory of
what transpired (your character's save state data will be reverted to the last
psychiatrist visit).
